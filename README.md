# IL-1Ra-TB
Code in this repository was used to analyze single cell RNA-seq data in the manuscript titled "Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is a conserved driver of tuberculosis"

File descriptions:
Flynn CD8 NHP_Clean.R - Analysis of a TB-infected non-human primate scRNA-seq dataset generated by the Flynn and Shalek labs.

Human TB signatures_clean.R - Analysis of human expression of IL-1Ra in PBMCs and the ability of mouse signatures to predict TB disease in humans using the TANDEM cohort.

ILC IL-1R.R - Analysis of a scRNA-seq dataset of innate lymphoid cells from Mtb-infected mixed bone marrow chimera consisting of wild-type and IL-1 receptor KO cells. The goal of this analysis is to identify which ILCs express IL-1 receptor and which genes expressed by these cells are regulated by IL-1.

T cell IL-1R.R - Analysis of a scRNA-seq dataset of T cells from Mtb-infected mixed bone marrow chimera consisting of wild-type and IL-1 receptor KO cells. The goal of this analysis is to identify which T cell populations express IL-1 receptor and which genes expressed by these cells are regulated by IL-1.

Stromal Cell Mtb.R - Analysis of stromal cells from Mtb-infected bone marrow chimeras generated by transferring wild-type bone marrow into wild-type or IL-1 receptor-deficient hosts. The goal of this analysis is to identify which non-hematopoietic populations express IL-1 receptor and which genes expressed by these cells are regulated by IL-1.

Nichnet on IL-1 Regulated Genes.R - Nichenet analysis to determine how the IL-1 regulated genes identified in the T cell, ILC, and stromal cell datasets regulates activation of Spp1+ or Trem2+ macrophages during Mtb infection.

Irg1 vs iNOS Mtb_clean.R - scRNA-seq analysis of the myeloid cell response to Mtb infection in Irg1 KO and iNOS KO mice.
